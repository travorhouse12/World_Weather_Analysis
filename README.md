# World_Weather_Analysis
This project aimed to assist PLANMYTRIP, a company that specializes in providing hotel and logding services to provide theirÂ customers with a better online experience. The ultimate goal for their front-end website was to collect and present data via the search page, which customers would then filter based on their preferred travel criteria to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. We used Jupyter Notebook and the citipy module to generate 2000 random longitudes and latitudes to complete this task. We then used the open weather map API to retrieve the JSON weather data for the cities. 

Next, we added the weather data to a pandas DataFrame that also contained various weather criteria. The dataframe was then cleaned and used to select the best cities to book a hotel in based on the city's temperature. The hotels in these cities were then mapped using the jupyter gmaps google places API, with the city name, weather, and hotel name displayed in the infoboxes. In addition, the customer could select four cities from a list of potential travel destinations based on their city temperature criteria. Finally, we used the Google Maps directions API to generate a travel route and a marker layer map between the four cities.
